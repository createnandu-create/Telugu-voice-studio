## Model weights: CC-BY-4.0

`model.safetensors` (the acoustic model) and the ONNX graphs `onnx/text_encoder.onnx` and `onnx/flow_decoder.onnx` (the same model, converted) are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode). They were trained on the Telugu part of the Rasa dataset by AI4Bharat (CC-BY-4.0, https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai4bharat/Rasa; credit: Praveen Srinivasa Varadhan, Ashwin Sankar, Giri Raju and Mitesh M. Khapra, *Rasa: Building Expressive Speech Synthesis Systems for Indian Languages in Low-resource Settings*, INTERSPEECH 2024).

When you use or share them, credit this model (link to its Hugging Face page) and the Rasa dataset (citation in README.md).

Changes made to the Rasa data before training: audio resampled from 48 kHz to 24 kHz; emotional-style recordings and clips shorter than 0.5 s or longer than 20 s removed; text normalised (Unicode NFC, numbers written out in words); rows whose text could not be read in Telugu script removed; training clips failing an automatic speech-recognition check removed (1.45 % female, 1.32 % male). No audio was otherwise altered.

`vocoder.safetensors` and `onnx/vocoder.onnx` are an unchanged copy (the latter converted to ONNX) of the pretrained Vocos weights `charactr/vocos-mel-24khz` (revision 0feb3fdd929bcd6649e0e7c5a688cf7dd012ef21), released under the MIT licence by its authors and trained on LibriTTS (CC-BY-4.0).
